# WP Format Utils

Display formatting: byte sizes, durations, compact numbers, word-safe truncation, deterministic initials avatars, and file-type labels. Parses back what it formats. Zero dependencies.

## Why

Every application rewrites these, and each rewrite is subtly worse than the last: a truncation that counts bytes and cuts a multi-byte character in half, a `100.0 MB` nobody wanted, an ordinal that renders `11st`, an avatar palette that reshuffles every time the list paginates.

None of it is hard. It is just never worth anybody's afternoon, so it gets done in five minutes and stays wrong.

## Features

- 💾 **Bytes both ways** — binary and decimal units, and a parser that reads `2 MB` back to `2097152`.
- ⏱️ **Durations in three registers** — `4:03` for media, `2h 5m` for tables, `about two hours` for prose.
- ✂️ **Truncation that counts characters** — never splits a word, never splits a codepoint, and includes the ellipsis in the budget.
- 🔢 **Compact numbers** — `1.2k`, `3.4M`, plus percentages and period-over-period change.
- 🎨 **Deterministic avatars** — an SVG data URI from a name; the same name is always the same colour.
- 📁 **File kinds** — coarse buckets for grouping and filtering, from a filename or a MIME type.


## Booleans

A value that has been through a database and a form is rarely a real boolean.
Meta comes back as the string `"0"`, a checkbox posts `"on"`, and a setting
that has been JSON encoded and decoded carries `"false"` — which PHP reads as
true, being a non-empty string.

```php
use ArrayPress\\FormatUtils\\Booleans;

Booleans::truthy( 'false' );   // false, not true
Booleans::yes_no( '0' );       // 'No'
Booleans::enabled( 'on' );     // 'Enabled'
```

`yes_no()`, `enabled()`, `on_off()` and `active()` go through the translation
functions, which is why they live here rather than inline.

## Nothing to show

```php
Text::dash( null );    // '—'
Text::dash( 0 );       // '0'  — zero is a value, not an absence
```

A blank cell in a list table reads as a column that failed to load.

## Requirements

PHP 8.3+

## Installation

```bash
composer require arraypress/wp-format-utils
```

## Bytes

```php
use ArrayPress\FormatUtils\Bytes;

Bytes::format( 1572864 );                  // '1.5 MB'
Bytes::format( 104857600 );                // '100 MB'  — not '100.0 MB'
Bytes::format( 1000, decimal: true );      // '1 kB'
Bytes::parse( '2 MB' );                    // 2097152
Bytes::parse( '1,024 KB' );                // 1048576
Bytes::rate( 1000000, 2.0 );               // '500 kB/s'
```

Binary (1 KB = 1024) is the default because this is usually describing a file, and it is what a filesystem reports and what an upload limit means. Decimal (1 kB = 1000) is what a disk manufacturer prints on the box and what a transfer rate uses — which is the entire content of "why does my 500 GB drive show 465 GB?":

```php
Bytes::format( 500 * (1000 ** 3), decimal: true );  // '500 GB'
Bytes::format( 500 * (1000 ** 3) );                 // '465.7 GB'
```

`parse()` reads `KB` and `KiB` alike as 1024, because people writing `KB` in a config file mean the binary unit.

## Durations

```php
use ArrayPress\FormatUtils\Duration;

Duration::clock( 243 );      // '4:03'      — media, aligned
Duration::clock( 3723 );     // '1:02:03'
Duration::compact( 7500 );   // '2h 5m'     — tables
Duration::words( 7500 );     // 'about 2 hours' — prose
Duration::parse( '2h 5m' );  // 7500
```

`clock()` omits the hour below an hour, because `0:04:03` on a four-minute track is noise. `compact()` shows two units by default, since the third never changes a decision. `words()` is deliberately imprecise: where a duration is read rather than measured, a rounded phrase carries the meaning and a precise one invites arithmetic the reader did not want to do.

## Text

```php
use ArrayPress\FormatUtils\Text;

Text::truncate( $title, 40 );              // word-safe, ellipsis inside the budget
Text::excerpt( $body, 160 );               // collapses newlines first
Text::initials( 'Dave Sherlock' );         // 'DS' — first and last, for a name
Text::initials( 'Trance Vol 1', from_start: true ); // 'TV' — first two, for a title
Text::list( ['a', 'b', 'c'] );             // 'a, b and c'
Text::list( $tags, limit: 2 );             // 'design, audio and 4 more'
Text::plural( 3, 'entry' );                // '3 entries'
Text::plural( 2, 'person', 'people' );     // '2 people'
Text::ordinal( 21 );                       // '21st'
Text::ordinal( 11 );                       // '11th'  — the teens are the trap
```

Truncation counts characters, not bytes, so a limit of 20 means twenty visible characters whether the text is English or Japanese. It only breaks at a word boundary if one is reasonably near the end — otherwise a long unbroken string would collapse to almost nothing.

`plural()` handles the common English endings and is not a linguistics engine: `person` becomes `persons` unless you say otherwise.

**Everything here returns plain text and escapes nothing.** Escape at the point of output, for the encoding of the place it is going.

## Numbers

```php
use ArrayPress\FormatUtils\Numbers;

Numbers::compact( 1200 );              // '1.2k'
Numbers::compact( 3400000 );           // '3.4M'
Numbers::compact( 847 );               // '847'   — already readable
Numbers::percent( 42.4 );              // '42%'
Numbers::share( 25, 100 );             // '25%'
Numbers::share( 5, 0 );                // '—'     — a share of nothing is undefined
Numbers::change( 120, 100 );           // '+20%'
Numbers::change( 50, 0 );              // 'new'
```

## Avatars

```php
use ArrayPress\FormatUtils\Avatar;

Avatar::svg( 'Dave Sherlock' );        // data:image/svg+xml;utf8,… → straight into <img src>
Avatar::hue( 'Dave Sherlock' );        // 214 — tint something else to match
Avatar::colour( 'Dave Sherlock' );     // 'hsl(214,55%,42%)'
```

Deterministic: the same name always yields the same colour, so a list does not reshuffle its palette as you scroll or paginate. The hue comes from a hash of the name; saturation and lightness are fixed, which keeps every generated colour in one family instead of producing the occasional neon.

No network request, no upload, nothing to store. The initials are XML-escaped, because the name is user data being written into markup.

## File types

```php
use ArrayPress\FormatUtils\FileType;

FileType::kind( 'photo.jpg' );                       // 'image'
FileType::kind( 'https://x.com/a/photo.jpg?v=2' );   // 'image'
FileType::kind_of_mime( 'application/pdf' );         // 'document'
FileType::label( 'invoice.pdf' );                    // 'PDF document'
FileType::extension( '/a/b/PHOTO.JPG' );             // 'jpg'
FileType::kinds();                                   // key => label, for a filter
FileType::pretty( 'https://x.com/' );                // 'x.com'
FileType::pretty( 'Presets/Massive Pack.zip' );      // 'Massive Pack.zip'
```

Kinds are deliberately coarse — `image`, `video`, `audio`, `document`, `sheet`, `slides`, `archive`, `code`, `font`, `other`. A file list wants six or seven buckets a person can filter by, not the ninety distinct types a MIME database knows about.

> **Never decide whether an upload is safe from its extension.** The extension is chosen by whoever uploaded it. This is presentation only; sniff the contents.

`pretty()` keeps the extension after stripping a prefix, because without it a filename column reads like the title column above it — which is exactly the confusion it was written to fix.

## Testing

```bash
composer install
composer test
```

139 tests — both byte conventions and their disagreement, round trips through every parser, multi-byte truncation, the ordinal teens, avatar determinism and escaping, and file kinds from paths, URLs and MIME types.
